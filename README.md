 I chose this image because although it gets hard sometimes you have to continue to stay motivated. Starting or jumping into new journeys especially in one as difficult as tech will bring 
in doubt and worry. Remebering to always keep an open mind and positive outlook with a little determination and consistency and knowing that just that is all we really need to be truly successful
in anything we set out to do. Everyone a little now and then needs a little encouragement to just keep going!
